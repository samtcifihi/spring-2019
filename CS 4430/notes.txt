Class overview and available resources.
4430 and 5430 are the sections for the course (I am in 4430); no practical difference within the class, though.
"DBMS": Database Management Software
"Database"
We are not concerned with the content of the database: only the structure. DBMS is the software which is used to manage the database. From now on, when we talk about a database, we are talking about the DBMS, not the content.
Databases are everywhere.
"IDG": International Data Group
Most CS Jobs are DB related.
The job of a computer is to keep a record of history.
using: "MySQL", though HW assignments can be done in any ORM DBMS.
using: Whatever language we want, but Java is the default for this class.
this class: How to Use a Database System (DBMS): Theory, SQL, data model, application development, database design, XML.

Uses: Web Searching, Data Mining, Scientific and Medical Databases, Integrating Information
Databases are the only areas yet found in which Turing-completness is not required for a language to make sense. Succinct programming, but subject to query optimization problems.
SQL is very specialized.
Databases often suffers from "Concurrency Control Problems" whenat two or more actions conflict and need to be resolved.
The OS mangages computer resources and provides a common environment for programs to be written for. The OS is applications on the kernel, which is on the CPU, the Memory, and the Devices.
Databases provide Data Independence, Security, Concurrency Resolution, Backup/Recoverery, and Easy CRUD with SQL.
"Data Model": Mathematical Representation of Data, Operations on Data, Constraints
The Relational Data Model is the most commonly-used model.
The Relational Model is a table. The table has a name: the Relation Name. The Column headers are Attributes, the rows are Tuples.
Table == Relation in this class.
