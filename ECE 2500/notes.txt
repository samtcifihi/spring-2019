Latches
	Present State
	Next State
	Send a 1 to the 0-gate and 0 to the 1-gate in order to flip the state.
	Send a 1 to both gates to hold the state.
	"01": "Set" to 1
	"10": "Reset" to 0
Latch with Enable (clock) (flip-flop)
	E: 0 for No Change, 1 for Set or Reset.
	D: 0 means Reset, 1 means Set

:: 1203-03-17 ::
nth clock period begins at t_n
T = t_(n+1) - t_n
f = 1/(Tc) (inverse of the period)
Tc = 5Ms (5 is the value, M is the unit, s is the time)
ALU
toggle (in addition to No Change, Reset, and Set)
