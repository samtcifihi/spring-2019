set: unordered collection of objects
Roster Notation
Set-Builder Notation
Sets can be elements of other sets.
The empty set is NOT equal to to a set containing the empty set.
A = B iff for all x, all x taken from A == all x taken from B.
"Proper Subset": if A is a subset of B, but A != B, A is a Proper Subset of B.
"Power Set": The set of all subsets of  a set A is the power set of A. If a set has n elements, the cardinality of the power set is 2^n.
Tuple.
Ordered n-tuple.
2-tuples are called ordered pairs.
Cartesian Product (Cross Product)
logical conjuction symbol looks like an "A" for "and"
union symbol looks like a "U"
Relations: A subset R of A cartesian-product B is called a relation...
"Set Operations": Things to do to sets to get new sets.
"Union"
"Intersection"
"Complement": Complement of A is all x in the Universe such that x !IN A.
"Difference" (aka: complement of B with respect to A)
"Identity Laws"
"Domination Laws"
"Idempotent Laws"
"Complementation Law"
"Commutative Laws"
"Associative Laws"
"Distributive Laws"
"De Morgan's Laws" proof of the second
"Absorption Laws"
"Complement Laws"
One way to prove an identity is to show that each is a subset of the other.
"Membership Table"
"Function" (many to one relation)
"Range": What you actually map to
"Codomain": What you can map to
"Image"
"Preimage"
range v. codomain
"Injective Function": one-to-one
"Surjective Function": iff every element in B has a preimage.
"Bijective Function": iff it is injective AND surjective
"Composition" like the Chain Rule from Calculus
